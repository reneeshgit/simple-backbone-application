simple-backbone-application
===========================

A simple backbone interface for add/edit and delete customers with a 'Load more' like pagination that is in facebook.

This backbone interface using 'Mustache' as a template engine.. a very simple template engine.

It may be not a perfect code. But it is simple and sure you will get a good idea of the backbone.

Its api is developed in laravel. So I just uploaded the code of the api. You need to make your own api with this as a sample.
